# ClassIn Mover Release v2.0.1

Add auto check updates.

## ClassIn Mover

Run this program, then enter a classroom.

The program will be started on the minimized status, which only a transparent icon is displayed. You can click it to open the main window, which can move, resize, and set z-order (or topmost) of your selected ClassIn window.

Auto patch is enabled as default, which will automatically resize the window into normal state like other applications once a new ClassIn window has been detected. You can disable this feature by right-clicking the minimized icon. The button `Auto Patch` on the main window will not enable this feature, but just patch the selected window.

### Known issues

-   **This program calls native API and thus can only work on Windows.**
    
-   `Auto Patch` may cause the window to be shown in full screen most of time. To exit from this, please drag on the second region to resize the window.
