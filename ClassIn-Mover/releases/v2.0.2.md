# ClassIn Mover Release v2.0.2

Fix bug: Window is full screen most of time after patching

Add "Patch all" to right-click menu

Auto patch window will now delay 8.5s when a new window detected, to ensure that the classroom has successfully entered.

## ClassIn Mover

Run this program, then enter a classroom.

The program will be started on the minimized status, which only a transparent icon is displayed. You can click it to open the main window, which can move, resize, and set z-order (or topmost) of your selected ClassIn window.

Auto patch is enabled as default, which will automatically resize the window into normal state like other applications once a new ClassIn window has been detected. You can disable this feature by right-clicking the minimized icon. The button `Auto Patch` on the main window will not enable this feature, but just patch the selected window.
