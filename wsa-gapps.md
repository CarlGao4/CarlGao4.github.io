## Description

This project intends to provide builds for [LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) because the build process of the original project requires Linux but most users don't have the ability to operate. 

The build provider has no relationship with the author of the original project.
